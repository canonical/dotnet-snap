## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/demo.gif)

This is the source code for the .NET snap package. It includes shared .NET components, such as the latest .NET host, as well as an installer tool that will allow you to install several versions of .NET side-by-side, all within your snap environment.

## Built With

This project is built with:

- Snapcraft
- C# (.NET 8)
- Some (little) bash scripting :)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

None really. Just make sure you're running a Linux distro that supports snaps.

### Installation

1. Install the .NET snap from the Snapcraft store
```
$ sudo snap install --classic dotnet
```

## Usage

When you first install the .NET snap, you will already have a fully working SDK installation of the latest .NET LTS (currently, .NET 8). In order to manage the versions you have installed, you have to use the .NET installer tool, which is embedded within the snap package.

### List

To see which versions you currently have installed in your system, simply run `dotnet installer list`.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
